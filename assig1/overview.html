		<p>As the first day begins, a player will need to collect resources in order to survive.  The <strong>main objective</strong> for a player when they first spawn inside a world is to collect <strong>logs</strong>. 
		<strong><a href="#log">Logs</a></strong> can be obtained from trees and can be added to a players inventory through holding down the left mouse button while the cursor is on the block. Logs are a neccessary ingredient for players to craft basic tools and materials needed to progress further into the game.</p>
		<p>Through the e hotkey, players can access their <strong><abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr></strong>. Here a player is able to see their inventory where all of their items are stored. Moreover, they will have access to the player's armor slots, recipe book and a 2x2 square crafting area. By utilizing the crafting area, a player can make a <strong>crafting table</strong> using the logs they have obtained.</p>
		<p>The <strong><a href="#table">crafting table</a></strong> is used to make basic tools like a <strong>wooden <a href="#pick">pickaxe</a></strong> needed to mine blocks such as cobblestone and coal. Cobblestone can be obtained from mining stone blocks which can be used to make a <strong>furnace.</strong> A <strong><a href="#furnace">furnace</a></strong> is neccessary in order to cook food and smelt any ore. A <strong>pickaxe</strong> is especially useful in order to obtain coal that a player has mined. Coal is a useful item that can be used to make food and <strong><a href="#torch">torches</a></strong> which provides lighting.</p>

		<p>During the night, the primary dangers would be hostile <strong><abbr title="monsters">mobs</abbr></strong> that spawn only during the dark. Here, I list some of the most commonly seen mobs in the game.</p>
		<ul class="square">
			<li>Zombies</li>
			<li>Skeletons</li>
			<li>Creepers</li>
			<li>Spiders</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There are many efficient ways to kill a mob however, a sword is the most commonly picked method. If a player waits a certain amount of time between attacks with their weapon, they would be able to <strong>deal bonus damage</strong> in comparison if they attacked a target without any delay between attacks. Although killing a monster may be thrilling to do, many players die due to a lack of experience. What they should do is build a <strong>shelter</strong> and wait out the night as monsters will die from the sunlight during the day time.</p>

	<p>Before a player's first night, they should make a shelter of any block in order to secure a safe home away from danger. This allows a player to avoid dangers and a higher chance of not being killed by a monster. Potential homes would depend on the <strong>landscape</strong>. For instance a flat space would be an ideal location so players would be able to</p>
	<ul class="square">
		<li>Have a good view of the surrounding area</li>
		<li>Open space for decorations</li>
		<li>Fence around house for extra protection</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A <strong><a href="#bed">bed</a></strong> is an item that a player should aim to get as it is used to skip the night time and wake up during the day. It also sets the spawn point if a player were to die.</p>

	<p>After making tools and a shelter, a player's next objective would be to find <strong>food</strong>. <strong><a href="#hunger">Hunger</a></strong> level decreases as a player moves around. When the hunger bar drops below 90%, the player will not regenerate health. If a player is below 30%, the player will not be able to sprint. If the hunger bar becomes empty, players will slowly lose health. Hunger level is drained rapidly when a player: </p>
	<ul class="square">
		<li>Attacking monsters and receiving damage</li>
		<li>Sprinting by double-tapping the forward w key.</li>
		<li>Jumping</li>
		<li>Swimming and mining blocks</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Food</strong> is neccessary to fill up your hunger bar. Having a basic crop farm to make bread or breeding animals and killing them to get meat is necessary for survival.</p>
