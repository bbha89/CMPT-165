			<h2 class="subh">Entry 1: Nice Result</h2>
			<p> A nice result that I am proud of is having links to other pages and being able to change the font, color and adding an underline to these links when a user hovers above the link using CSS pseudo-class. Here is an example when a person hovers over a link using the &lt;a&gt; tag. <a href="https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/165/common/study-guide/">Cool Link</a></p>
			<p>Something I would like to be able to do but I do not know YET how to do it would be adding cool effects using JavaScript to make my webpages more interactive and interesting when a user is viewing and interacting with the content and markup found on my webpages.</p>

			<h2 class="subh">Entry 4: After Midterm</h2>
			<p> Topics that I realize I am comfortable with is converting between bases. That being going from base 16 or 2 to base 10 as well converting between base 16 and base 2. Another topic that I realized I am comfortable with is relative addressing when the file to link to is in the same folder as the original html file and when it is in a subfolder of the original html file. This helped me for the assignments in order to access my CSS file and images when I had them in a subfolder.</p>
			<p> A topic that I was tested in the midterm that I would like to review more is using the CSS .class selector. I used ul.li thinking it would access all the unordered list with &lt;li&gt; element. However, I did not think that the .li would be a class.</p>

			<h2 class="subh">Entry 5: Javascript</h2>
			<p onclick="clicked()"> An example that I can do with JavaScript is displaying an alert box when a user interacts with the text. For example, if a user clicks a part of <strong>this paragraph</strong>, then a function will be called and will access the alert() method that will display an alert box with a message and an OK button.</p>

			<h2 class="subh">Entry 6: Concept about Programming and JavaScript</h2>
			<p> Programming Language is a way to describe to a computer some behaviour. For instance a calculation or another action that you want the computer to do for you(Therefore a programming language describes a program). Javascript is a programming language which lets you access and modify the content and markup of webpages while the user is viewing/interacting with them and it can respond to user events(entering some text) as well as combining them together to form a logical espressed in programs.</p>
			<p onclick="sum()">An example would be adding two variables together. In this example when a user clicks this <strong>paragraph</strong>, a function is called or executed and will sum two variables together stored in a new variable and will display this variables result being 15 in an alert message.</p>
