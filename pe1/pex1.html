	<h1>My First Website</h1>
	<p> Welcome to my very	<strong> FIRST </strong> website! </p>
	<p> <dfn> HTML </dfn> is a markup language for creating web pages.</p>
	<p> It is what I used to create this site!</p>
	<p> The <strong> strong tag </strong> is an example of what I used in the creation of my website. </p>
	<p> <dfn> strong </dfn> is used to define <strong> important text. </strong> </p>
	<p> A language I have experience with is Python. </p>
	<p> Python has many functions like <code> upper() </code> which converts all lowercase characters to uppercase and <code> lower() </code> which does the opposite. </p>
	<p> This concludes my first website. Bye! </p>
